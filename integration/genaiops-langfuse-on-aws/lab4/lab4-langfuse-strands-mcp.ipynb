    "# Evaluating Strands Agent with Observability with LangFuse\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this module, we'll explore how to implement observability for [Strands Agent](https://strandsagents.com/latest/) using [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/). Strands Agent enables you to build an intelligent AWS assistant by connecting foundation models to AWS services and resources, here's the link to [Strands Agent SDK's GitHub repo](https://github.com/strands-agents). While powerful AI agents can solve complex problems, understanding their behavior and performance requires robust observability solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Langfuse integration provides comprehensive visibility into your agent's operations, helping you monitor, debug, and optimize its performance. This module will guide you through implementing and leveraging Langfuse observability with Strands Agent to create more reliable, transparent, and effective AI solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what you will learn from this module:\n",
    "1. Setup Lanfuse Observability \n",
    "2. Create a Strands Agent with [built-in tools](https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/user-guide/concepts/tools/example-tools-package/) and trace it with Lanfuse\n",
    "3. Create a Strands Agent with [custom tools](https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/user-guide/concepts/tools/python-tools/) and trace it with Lanfuse\n",
    "4. Lastly create a Strands Agent with [MCP tools](https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/user-guide/concepts/tools/mcp-tools/) and trace it with Lanfuse\n",

    "tool integration approaches with comprehensive tracing capabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "We successfully implemented built-in tools using the `image_reader` for AWS architecture analysis, created custom tools like the \n",
    "`aws_health_status_checker` for real-time service monitoring, and integrated `MCP (Model Context Protocol)` tools combining AWS Documentation and Pricing servers for complex multi-tool workflows. The key achievement was establishing complete observability through OpenTelemetry integration with StrandsTelemetry, enabling real-time monitoring of agent decision-making processes, tool usage patterns, and performance metrics in the Langfuse console. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we conclude this lab, you've gained valuable experience in building transparent, monitorable AI agents that transform from black boxes into production-ready systems with comprehensive observability, preparing you for deploying robust agentic systems with confidence in enterprise environments."
